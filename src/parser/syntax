scalability: 

    type safety
    memory safety
    modularity
    no-undefined behaviour
    testing 
    generics 
    enumerated types



thing I dislike about haskell:
    
    No parametrized classes.
    No asociated types.
    No modularity: 
        no dot notation for struct fields
        no methods
        no modularity for classes


    List and Strings literals are Linked lists, not arrays (hence slow).
    String and Char are ascii only.
    No trailing comma






data Variable_name {
    type_declarations,
}





Expressions



typechecker:

    check correct number of args
